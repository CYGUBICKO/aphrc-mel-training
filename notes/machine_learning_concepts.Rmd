# Basic concepts

## What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?

\begin{itemize}[label=\textcolor{blue}{$\diamond$}]
\item AI is the simulation of human intelligence by machines, enabling them to learn, reason, and self-correct
\item Involves tasks like learning from data, making decisions, and improving over time.
\item \textbf{Examples:} Virtual assistants, image recognition, and LLMs (chatbots like ChatGPT) are all AI applications
\item \textbf{In MEL:} AI provides the broad framework for automating cognitive tasks in MEL, such as analyzing data and generating insights
\end{itemize}


## What is Machine Learning (ML)?

\begin{itemize}[label=\textcolor{blue}{$\diamond$}]
\item ML is a subset of AI that focuses on building systems that learn—and improve—as they consume more data
\item Instead of explicit programming, ML models use algorithms to identify patterns in data and make predictions
\item \textbf{Examples:} Spam filters, recommendation engines, and predictive models are all powered by ML
\item \textbf{In MEL:} ML can be used for tasks like predictive  \textbf{trend analysis} or  \textbf{anomaly detection} in monitoring data
\end{itemize}


## What is Deep Learning?

\begin{itemize}[label=\textcolor{blue}{$\diamond$}]
\item Deep Learning is a specialized subset of ML that uses \textbf{multi-layered neural networks} (inspired by the brain) to learn complex patterns
\item Deep learning models excel at processing unstructured data (text, images, audio) and power modern AI like LLMs and image recognition
\item \textbf{Examples:} Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for images, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)/Transformers for text (LLMs are Transformer-based deep learning models)
\item \textbf{In MEL:} Deep learning enables advanced NLP techniques for understanding and generating human language from reports and feedback
\end{itemize}


## What is Natural Language Processing (NLP)?

\begin{itemize}[label=\textcolor{blue}{$\diamond$}]
\item NLP enables computers to interpret, analyze, and generate human language
\item It is a field of AI that combines linguistics and ML to process text and speech (e.g., understanding reports, transcriptions)
\item \textbf{Examples:} Sentiment analysis, translation, keyword extraction, summarization, and chatbots
\item \textbf{In MEL:} NLP can automate analysis of qualitative data, such as categorizing survey responses or summarizing narrative reports
\end{itemize}



## What are Large Language Models (LLMs)? 

\begin{itemize}[label=\textcolor{blue}{$\diamond$}]
\item LLMs are machine learning models trained on massive text datasets to understand and generate human-like text
\item LLMs (like Google’s Gemini, OpenAI’s GPT) use deep learning (transformer networks) to predict and generate text based on input prompts
\item They can summarize text, answer questions, translate languages, and more by analyzing context and patterns in huge corpora
\item \textbf{Examples:} ChatGPT, Google Bard/Gemini, Meta’s Llama. These models can be accessed via APIs (like \pkg{gemini.R} in \proglang{R}) for automated text tasks
\end{itemize}


## LLMs vs NLP Models

\begin{itemize}[label=\textcolor{blue}{$\diamond$}]
\item LLMs are broad and generate fluent text; NLP models are often task-specific (e.g., sentiment analysis, translation)
\item Both use large datasets and ML to interpret language. LLMs are a type of generative AI; NLP encompasses both generative and analytical language tools
\item An LLM can generate a report summary on its own, while a traditional NLP model might only score sentiment or extract entities
\item We can use LLMs (via \pkg{gemini.R}) for a wide range of MEL tasks (summarization, Q\&A), whereas specific NLP tools (built on ML) can handle targeted tasks like coding feedback
\end{itemize}


# AI for MEL

## Why AI/ML for MEL?

\begin{itemize}[label=\textcolor{blue}{$\diamond$}]
\item AI automates manual analysis and reporting tasks
\item Real-time data processing allows quicker insights and decision-making (e.g., generating a report summary instantly)
\item Machine learning reduces human error and improves consistency in data handling
\item AI systems can process vast amounts of data (multiple reports, years of trends)
\end{itemize}

## AI/ML Use Cases in MEL

\begin{itemize}[label=\textcolor{blue}{$\diamond$}]
\item Automated reporting - Generate executive summaries of quarterly reports automatically
\item Trend analysis - Identify changes in key indicators over time (e.g., rising incidence, budget variances)
\item Sentiment analysis - Categorize and analyze textual feedback or stakeholder comments for sentiment and themes
\item Predictive - Forecast project outcomes or risks (e.g., anticipating resource needs)
\item Data validation - Use anomaly detection to flag data entry errors
\end{itemize}


## Examples of Use Cases Prompts

\begin{itemize}[label=\textcolor{blue}{$\diamond$}]
\item Summarize reports - \textit{“Summarize the key findings and trends in this quarter’s report”}
\item Extracting indicators - \textit{“List the key indicators and their current values from this report.”}
\item Trend analysis - \textit{“Compare the trends in indicator X between Q1 and Q4”}
\end{itemize}


## Best Practice -  Prompt Design

\begin{itemize}[label=\textcolor{blue}{$\diamond$}]
\item Be specific - Clear instructions yield better results (e.g., “Summarize the key findings” vs “Tell me about this report”)
\item Provide context - Include necessary details in the prompt (e.g., time frame, project name)
\item Use Examples - If possible, give one example in your prompt (e.g., “Like this example: …”)
\item Check Output format - Specify desired format (bullet points, summary paragraph, list)
\item Iterate - Try multiple prompt phrasings to see which yields the best answer.
\end{itemize}


# gemini.R Package

## Introducing gemini.R

\begin{itemize}[label=\textcolor{blue}{$\diamond$}]
\item An R package that interfaces with Google’s Gemini LLM API
\item Enables R users to leverage a powerful LLM for tasks like text generation, summarization, Q\&A, directly within R
\item Simple functions (e.g., \code{gemini("prompt")}) to send text prompts to Gemini and receive responses.
\end{itemize}


## Capabilities

\begin{itemize}[label=\textcolor{blue}{$\diamond$}]
\item Text generation
\item Image/Audio analysis
\item Customization via different models
\item Integrates with various data pipelines
\item Well documented
\end{itemize}


## Installation

\begin{itemize}[label=\textcolor{blue}{$\diamond$}]
\item Practical session
